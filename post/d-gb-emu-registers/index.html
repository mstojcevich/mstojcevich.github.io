<h1 id="about-the-gameboy-cpu">About the Gameboy CPU</h1>

<p>The Gameboy uses a custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 CPU (henceforth referred to as the &ldquo;Gameboy CPU&rdquo;), which uses a modified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> instruction set, which itself is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080">Intel 8080</a>.</p>

<p>The registers of the Gameboy CPU are identical to those of the 8080. Each main register is 8 bits wide, though in many instructions the regsiters can be accessed as groups of two adjacent registers, and are then treated as 16-bit; for example, the register <em>AF</em> is a combination of <em>A</em> and <em>F</em> with the bits of <em>A</em> used as the most significant and <em>F</em> as least significant. A table of the registers is seen below:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{array}{r l}
0..7 &amp; 8..15 \\<br />
\hline
\mathrm{A} &amp; \mathrm{F} \\<br />
\mathrm{B} &amp; \mathrm{C} \\<br />
\mathrm{D} &amp; \mathrm{E} \\<br />
\mathrm{H} &amp; \mathrm{L} \\<br />
\rlap{\text{SP}} \\<br />
\rlap{\text{PC}}
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>The reason that the register to the right of <em>A</em> is called <em>F</em> and not <em>B</em> is that <em>F</em> is used for flags set as side effects of certain operations. Because of this, <em>F</em> isn&rsquo;t typically accessable in the same way that the other registers are.</p>

<p>The observant will notice that for <em>SP</em> and <em>PC</em>, the letters are right next to each other while the others are spaced out;
this is not a typo, as these registers are special in that they are always treated as 16 bits wide. <em>SP</em> indicates the stack pointer and <em>PC</em> indicates the program counter.
These registers typically cannot be modified the same as others can, only being accessable using special operations.</p>

<p>Another &ldquo;special&rdquo; register is <em>HL</em> &ndash; while this register is treated the same as the normal registers in that the 8-bit halves are registers on their own, <em>HL</em> is often used in operations as a pointer to memory.</p>

<h1 id="representing-the-registers-in-d">Representing the registers in D</h1>

<p>Because the registers can be accessed individually or grouped by two, there are quite a few ways that different Gameboy emulators choose to represent them.</p>

<p>Many emulators written in Java and C++ encapsulate each register pair within an object, holding either two 8-bit integers or one 16-bit integer, with helper methods to set the halves or the whole, which usually will use bit manipulation tricks as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_punning">type-punning</a> isn&rsquo;t possible or is undefined.</p>

<p>When I started this emulator project, I used C++. Part of the reason that I decided to switch to D was my hacky workaround for storing registers without needing bit manipulation.
Because using unions for type punning is undefined behavior in C++ (it&rsquo;s actually allowed in C), I had to resort to trickier methods. Using a method that is probably worse than using the aforementioned undefined behavior, I resorted pointer and casting magic: I allocated an array of 8-bit integers large enough to fit all of the registers, and created pointers to 8-bit and 16-bit integers to refer to the individual registers and register groups respectively. This is very hacky, and, without looking too far into the C++ specification, I would assume that this trick would result in different values when reading the 16-bit register groups on host machines with different endianness.</p>

<p>So, can D do this better? Despite not being very familiar with the D &ldquo;way&rdquo; of doing things (this is my first project in D), I have come up with a way that is at least better than what I was doing in C++.</p>

<h3 id="type-punning-using-unions">Type punning using unions</h3>

<p>I mentioned type punning using unions already, when talking about how it wasn&rsquo;t possible in C++. As far as I can tell from skimming the web, punning with unions is defined in D, and it is the best way that I can think of to represent the registers. This may cause issues with different endianness (it probably will), but I have no easy way to check and I&rsquo;m only worried about x86 for now. If endianness matters, I&rsquo;ll update this blog entry.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with unions, they essentially allow you to use a single variable as multiple types. They are similar to structs, except instead of storing multiple values, they store a single value in multiple ways. Unions are the size of the largest member. Hopefully an example will say more than words.</p>

<p>To explain type punning using unions, I will use the following example:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #272822"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #66d9ef">union</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">PunnedRegister</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">{</span>
    <span style="color: #66d9ef">short</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">ab;</span> <span style="color: #75715e">// Grouped 8-bit values</span>

    <span style="color: #66d9ef">struct</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">{</span> <span style="color: #75715e">// In order of least significant to most significant</span>
        <span style="color: #66d9ef">byte</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">b;</span> <span style="color: #75715e">// Right value</span>
        <span style="color: #66d9ef">byte</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">a;</span> <span style="color: #75715e">// Left value</span>
    <span style="color: #f8f8f2">}</span>
<span style="color: #f8f8f2">}</span>

<span style="color: #66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">main()</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">{</span>
    <span style="color: #f8f8f2">PunnedRegister</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">r;</span>

    <span style="color: #f8f8f2">r.a</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">=</span> <span style="color: #ae81ff">0xA</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">;</span>
    <span style="color: #f8f8f2">r.b</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">=</span> <span style="color: #ae81ff">0xB</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">;</span>
    <span style="color: #f8f8f2">writefln(</span><span style="color: #e6db74">&quot;%04X&quot;</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">,</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">r.ab);</span>
<span style="color: #f8f8f2">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This code outputs <code>0A0B</code> as expected.</p>

<p>The way that this works is that <em>PunnedRegister</em> can either be accessed as single a 16-bit integer or as a struct of two 8-bit integers (which is anonymous, so the integers can be accessed transparently).
When accessed as one of the two 8-bit integers, either the left or right half of the 16-bit value is accessed &ndash; when accessed as a 16-bit integer, the combination of the two 8-bit integers is accessed.</p>

<h1 id="the-final-representation">The final representation</h1>

<p>Using mixins to reduce the amount of repetitive code, this is how the registers will be represented in the emulator:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #272822"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #66d9ef">alias</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">reg16</span> <span style="color: #f8f8f2">=</span> <span style="color: #66d9ef">short</span><span style="color: #f8f8f2">;</span>

<span style="color: #f8f8f2">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I also aliased short to reg16 and byte to reg8 in case I find it important to make them unsigned in the future or alter how they are stored in some other way. Unlike C/C++, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to change the alias on different platforms since type size is <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/type.html">guarenteed</a>.</p>

<p>Because the <em>SP</em> and <em>PC</em> have letters that are shared with individual registers, they can&rsquo;t use the same method of representation as the other registers.</p>

<p>The only downside that I&rsquo;ve noticed so far is that my editor doesn&rsquo;t like to autocomplete the registers.</p>
